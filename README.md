Telecom Churn Analysis

Overview

This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a telecom churn dataset. The goal is to understand key patterns and factors that contribute to customer churn. The dataset contains various customer attributes such as account length, usage metrics, customer service calls, and whether a customer churned or not. By analyzing this data, we aim to derive insights that can help in retaining customers and improving telecom services.
